# Detail of tasks and sprints

## Objective

The main objective is coordinate a lean programming and efficient sprints, seeking for quality and precision.
The project starts with a simple task of creating the main website interface and positioning the elements, without thinking about the game itself nor the backend functionalities.

## Separating the tasks

### Fundamentals and framework basics
First step for learning framework programming is understanding the structure behind the scenes. When we learn Vanilla Javascript, for instance, we can follow a _software design pattern_ for describing and implementing software constructs in terms of their responsibilities, making the code more readable and organised. A software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements is the known **MVC** (_model–view–controller_). This pattern helps us to understand where and when we must use some elements in a framework.

Second step is understanding the cycle _state -> component -> actions -> mutations -> state_, as shown in the following figure.

### 1) UX
  - Designing the interface from scratch.
  - Development of the design using the **Quant UX** online tool
  - Studying the elements positioning
  - Creating a friendly and pleasant design for buttons
  - Deciding the background and additional features on the foreground

### 2) UI
  - Coding the basic features
  - Coding the card design
  - Coding the interface design

### 3) Marketplace elements
  - Coding the components
  - Connecting the elements and components

### 4) Backend and Back Office
  - Connecting the frontend to the backend structures
  - Creating the backend server host configuration

## Sprints
The sprints shall occur when each task needed to be completed. These sprints appear as the task needs adjustments to be completed. Nevertheless, some sprints can be listed below.

  - ~~Creating the cards.ts with the cards properties (first step, for getting excited)~~
  - ~~Sketching the website interface~~
  - Coding the main website interface
  - Coding the website style
  - Coding the links
  - Coding the cards style
  - Coding the authentication fields
  - Creating the mock files for testing
