# Marketplace with Vue

#

## About it

This repository is a Marketplace Project signed to me by Yoyo Sensei from Japan.

The main goal is creating a card game with marketplace format from scratch using the framework Vue.js. It is almost the same project of the last marketplace project, but this is not only front end coding, we will create all the structures and services that will make possible to implement it for other application.

### It's not done yet...

This project is partially done, I need to do many things yet. The project is just for code practicing in VueJS and to put some ideas on it.

### The deployment

For now, the deployment was done using _Vercel_, that is a great choice when we want visualise whether the application is working or not. You can see it by clicking <a href="https://marketplace-with-vue-seven.vercel.app/" alt="Marketplace in Vue" target="_blank"> Marketplace in Vue</a>.
