# Marketplace with Vue
#
### About it

This repository is a Marketplace Project signed to me by Yoyo Sensei from Japan.

The main goal is creating a card game with marketplace format from scratch using  the framework Vue.js. It is almost the same project of the last marktplace project, but this is not only front end coding, we will create all the structures and services that will make possible to implement it for other application.

#### The rules for this project are:

- Use Vue.js framework;
- Use TypeScript;
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Vanilla) are allowed;
